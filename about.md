**Nota Lepidopterologica** is the peer-reviewed journal of the Society for European Lepidopterology (SEL) published by Pensoft. As a society journal, we are committed to being a venue for publishing to our members; to bringing high-quality research to the scientific community interested in Lepidoptera through open access; and to providing these services using modern technology.

We publish original research papers on taxonomy, morphology/anatomy, phylogenetics, biogeography, ecology, behaviour, conservation, and natural history of Lepidoptera, but also on any other aspects of lepidopterology. The journal is devoted mostly but not exclusively to Palaearctic Lepidoptera. Comprehensive studies in any of the above-mentioned areas are given preference over studies with a very limited scope. However, we also invite short contributions on important topics, such as invasive taxa, new records for large geographical areas, and other similar aspects. All papers are published in English, with a possibility ofthe summary in other languages in addition to English.

All submitted manuscripts are assigned for evaluation to one of the members of our international editorial board formed by the leading specialists in the various fields of lepidopterology. The manuscripts that are of high enough quality are then sent to at least two qualified experts for peer-review.
